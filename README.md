A text parser for counting words and sentence locations written in [Go.](http://golang.org)

## About

This is a small demonstration app of some Golang functions and features. Initially intended
to act as a bed for testing Golang development, it could form the framework for a larger application.

Some demonstration objectives:

* CLI flag parameter passing.
* CLI submission of data by file or by pipe.
* Concurrent worker jobqueue (here with a simple text parser/scanner).
* Webserver API:
    + Custom connection listener for optional throttling of connections.
    + Middleware for globally validating incoming requests.
    + Status information from the system.
    + Integration of pprof for performance profiling.
    + JSON encoding of the response body.
    + Standard RESTful request and response header usage.

For TODOs, please see TODO.md

## Usage

```
Description: Parse text counting words and sentence locations, This command can be
evoked as either a command line utility or as a stand alone server process.

Usage: clidemo [options...] [input_filename]

Server options:
    -N, --name NAME                  NAME of the server (default: empty field).
    -H, --hostname HOSTNAME          HOSTNAME of the server (default: localhost).
    -p, --port PORT                  PORT to listen on (default: 49152).
	-L, --profiler_port PORT         *PORT the profiler is listening on (default: off).
    -n, --connections MAX            *MAX server connections allowed (default: unlimited).
    -W, --workers MAX                MAX running workers allowed (default: 1000).
    -X, --procs MAX                  *MAX processor cores to use from the machine.

    -d, --debug                      Enable debugging output (default: false)

     *  Anything <= 0 is no change to the environment (default: 0).

File input options:
    -f, --file FILE                  Process input FILE

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
    -V, --version                    Show version

Examples:

    # Server mode activated as "San Francisco" on localhost port 8080;
	# 10 conns; 30 workers; 2 processors
    clidemo -N "San Francisco" -p 8080 -n 10 -W 30 -X 2

	# File input using -f flag with debug option
	clidemo -f /tmp/inputfiles/foo/bar.txt -d > out.txt

	# Implicit file input (no -f flag needed)
	clidemo /tmp/inputfiles/foo/bar.txt > out.txt

	# Piping input
	cat /tmp/inputfiles/foo/bar.txt | clidemo > out.txt

```

## Configuration

```
command line flags only

```

## Building

This code currently requires version 1.42 or higher of Go,

Information on Golang installation, including pre-built binaries, is available at
<http://golang.org/doc/install>.

Run `go version` to see the version of Go which you have installed.

Run `go build` inside the directory to build.

Run `go test ./...` to run the unit regression tests.

A successful build run produces no messages and creates an executable called `clidemo` in this
directory.

Run `go help` for more guidance, and visit <http://golang.org/> for tutorials, presentations, references and more.
