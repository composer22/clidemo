### [Dockerized] (http://www.docker.com) [clidemo](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/composer22/clidemo/)

A docker image for clidemo. This is created as a single static executable, so there are multiple passes through Docker to first build the static executable and then to package it under an empty (scratch) base image.
